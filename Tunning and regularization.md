## Learning Rate
- Too high a learning rate might overshoot the optimal solution
- Too small will take too long to find the optimal solution.

## Batch Size
- smaller batch size can work their way out of "local minima" more easily
- Too large can end up getting stuck in the wrong solution.

- Small batch sizes tend to not get stuck in local minima.
- Small Learning rates increase training time.
- Large batch size can converge on the wrong solution at random.
- Large learning rates can overshoot the correct solution.
