# Precision
>Precision ( positive predictive value ) is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances.
>																										*[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall)*

When a search engine returns 30 pages, only 20 of which are relevant, while failing to return 40 additional relevant pages.
Its precision = 20 / 30 = 2 / 3, which tells us how valid the results are.
	$$Precision = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$
`TP + FP = Total Predicted Postive`
