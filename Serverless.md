Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers (developers).
Cloud service providers still have to use servers to execute code for developers. However, developers of serverless applications are not concerned with capacity planning, configuration, managment, maintainance, fault tolerance or scaling of container, VMs, or physical servers.
