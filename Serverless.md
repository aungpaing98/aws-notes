Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers (developers).

Cloud service providers still have to use servers to execute code for developers. However, developers of serverless applications are not concerned with capacity planning, configuration, managment, maintainance, fault tolerance or scaling of container, VMs, or physical servers.

Since developer do not need to pay attention to the hardware usage, the application hosted with serverless can generally scale automatically and the service charge is depend on the throughput of the application.
