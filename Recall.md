>Recall ( true positive rate or sensitivity ) is the fraction of relevant instances that were retrieved. Both precision and recall are based on relevance (true positive).
>																										*[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall)*

When a search engine returns 30 pages, only 20 of which are relevant, while failing to return 40 additional relevant pages.
Its recall = 20 / 60 = 1 / 3, which tells us how **complete** the results are.
	$$Recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$

`TP + FN = Total Actual Positive`
