Unnormal data point in the dataset.

Variance ($\sigma ^ 2$)
- measures how "spread-out" the data is
- average of the squared differences from the mean

Standard Deviation ($\sigma$)
- square root of variance
- Usually used as a way to identify outliers. 
- Eg. Data points that lie more than *'one'* standard deviation from the mean can be considered unusal.
